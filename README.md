# Excel Data Analysis Automation

Welcome to my Excel Data Analysis Automation repository! This repository showcases a comprehensive workflow for data analysis and automation in Excel. The workflow consists of three parts: data consolidation, VBA automation, and formula-based analysis.

## Part 1: Data Consolidation
In this part, I used Dbeaver to consolidate multiple data sources into a single dataset. The consolidated data is stored in a standardized format for further analysis. The SQL queries, data transformation steps, and the final consolidated dataset can be found in the [Data Consolidation](./part1) folder.

## Part 2: VBA Automation
In this part, I developed a VBA script to automate the process of loading data into Excel and performing necessary formatting. The script retrieves data from the consolidated dataset and automatically formats it based on predefined rules. The VBA code, instructions, and sample data can be found in the [VBA Automation](./part2) folder.

## Part 3: Formula-based Analysis
In this part, I created various formulas and calculations to perform data analysis on the loaded and formatted data. The analysis includes statistical measures, trend analysis, and other relevant calculations. The Excel file with all the formulas and analysis can be found in the [Formula-based Analysis](./part3) folder.

## Usage
To utilize the Excel Data Analysis Automation workflow:
1. Start with the consolidated dataset obtained from Part 1.
2. Open the Excel file from Part 3.
3. Click the designated button to load the data using the VBA automation script.
4. The loaded data will be automatically formatted, and all necessary analysis will be calculated.
